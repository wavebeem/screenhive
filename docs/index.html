  Screenhive is an organizer for Steam screenshots,
  available for Windows and Mac.
</p>

<p>
  It's mostly self-explanatory, but it does also have an extra feature allowing
  you to organize Steam "uncompressed" (PNG) screenshots. Follow the
  instructions in the following image and select that folder as your screenshots
  destination inside Screenhive.
